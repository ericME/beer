BEER

recipes:

1. Dark Smoked Porter:
----------------------

For my first beer I wanted to skip all the pales and go right to something smokey and malty. Damn, was I ever glad I did. Single mash infusion, 2 weeks fermenting, kegged and force carbed.

A really nice beer.

|Characteristic | Notes:        |
| ------------- | ------------  |
|Appearance     |impenetrably dark, almost zero head retention|
|Aroma          |pleasantly mild, slight hop scent|
|Taste          |coffee and malty notes|
|Mouthfeel      |creamy, sub-milk|
|Overall        |tasty, got good reviews from those who tasted it|



2. Uncle Chunkle Chocolate Dunkel:
----------------------------------

I wanted to try a lager, so I rigged up an old freezer with a homemade temperature controller.

I also wanted to obeserve the tradition of the beer, so brewed with the triple decoction mash schedule.

I couldn't wait for the lager to finish, so this is my interim attempt.
