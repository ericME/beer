recipes:

1. Dark Smoked Porter:
----------------------

For my first beer I wanted to skip all the pales and go right to something smokey and malty. Damn, was I ever glad I did. Single mash infusion, 2 weeks fermenting, kegged and force carbed.

A really nice beer.

|Characteristic | Notes:        |
| ------------- | ------------  |
|Appearance     |impenetrably dark, almost zero head retention|
|Aroma          |pleasantly mild, slight hop scent|
|Taste          |coffee and malty notes|
|Mouthfeel      |creamy, sub-milk|
|Overall        |tasty, got good reviews from those who tasted it|



2. Uncle Chunkle Chocolate Dunkel:
---------------------------------
-

I wanted to try a lager, so I rigged up an old freezer with a homemade temperature controller.

I also wanted to obeserve the tradition of the beer, so brewed with the triple decoction mash schedule.

Primary: 2 weeks @ 50-55F
Diacetyl Rest: 3 days @ 65F
Rack to keg, then secondary: 2 months @ 35F

|Characteristic | Notes:        |
| ------------- | ------------  |
|Appearance     |very dark, reasonably frothy head, lots of lacing|
|Aroma          |mild, some people detected very slight hops|
|Taste          |slight chocolate note, smooth and delicious|
|Mouthfeel      |smooth, light, fresh|
|Overall        |a wonderful munich style dunkel; had visitors from germany who loved it|

3. Come Again Double Cream Ale:
-------------------------------

I couldn't wait for the lager to finish, so this is my interim attempt.
Primary: 2 weeks @ 70-75F
Rack to Keg, secondary 1 week at 40F.

|Characteristic | Notes:        |
| ------------- | ------------  |
|Appearance     |golden and bright, very frothy head|
|Aroma          |hints of the Willamette Hops|
|Taste          |slight corn flavor|
