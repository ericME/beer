recipes:

1. Dark Smoked Porter:
----------------------

For my first beer I wanted to skip all the pales and go right to something smokey and malty. Damn, was I ever glad I did. Single mash infusion, 2 weeks fermenting, kegged and force carbed.

A really nice beer.

2. Uncle Chunkle Chocolate Dunkel:
---------------------------------

I wanted to try a lager, so I rigged up an old freezer with a homemade temperature controller.

I also wanted to obeserve the tradition of the beer, so brewed with the triple decoction mash schedule.

Primary: 2 weeks @ 50-55F
Diacetyl Rest: 3 days @ 65F
Rack to keg, then secondary: 2 months @ 35F
