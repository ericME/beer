recipes:

1. Dark Smoked Porter:
----------------------

For my first beer I wanted to skip all the pales and go right to something smokey and malty. Damn, was I ever glad I did. Single mash infusion, 2 weeks fermenting, kegged and force carbed.

A really nice beer.

2. Uncle Chunkle Chocolate Dunkel:
---------------------------------
-

I wanted to try a lager, so I rigged up an old freezer with a homemade temperature controller.

I also wanted to obeserve the tradition of the beer, so brewed with the triple decoction mash schedule.

|Taste          |slight chocolate note, smooth and delicious|
|Mouthfeel      |smooth, light, fresh|
|Overall        |a wonderful munich style dunkel; even had visitors from germany who loved it|

I couldn't wait for the lager to finish, so this is my interim attempt.

4. Red Headed Step Cider:
-------------------------------

I used the cream ale yeast cake to ferement some apple juice. I added 2lbs of brown sugar and it turned out way to dry. Back sweetened with 1lb of honey and 1lb of raspberries boiled into a mash.
Primary: 2 weeks @ 70-90F
Rack to Keg, add CO2.

|Characteristic | Notes:        |
| ------------- | ------------  |
|Appearance     |hazey, uninviting brown|
|Aroma          |basically none|
|Taste          |slight fruitiness, the honey and raspberries made it bearable|
|Mouthfeel      |watery|
|Overall        |not my favorite, some poeple liked it, but not many.|
